            In 1887, the Foundress of the Institution, Mother Teresa of St.Rose of Lima, was commissioned to start a
            congregation of Carmelite sisters in Ernakulam, Kerala. The ministries of the congregation were confined to
            the state of Kerala until 1938, when a proposal was mooted by Dr.Colas, Bishop of Pondicherry to begin a
            school in Villupuram for its large catholic Anglo-Indian community. Mother Mary, the then Superior General
            condescended and out of the sylvan environs of emerald Ernakulam, ventured the pioneer quartet on their
            maiden journey to Villupuram, a typically torrid, tropical terrain on the western coast.
            The school is one of the oldest in the region and it continues to be one of the premium educational
            institutions in the district. The pioneers began a system of skill based learning system. The education
            system now has evolved into an effective curriculum according to the present day educational requirements.

            Sacred Heart Anglo-Indian Hr. Sec. School has a fine infrastructure with 66 spacious classrooms provided
            with digital monitors, furnished computer rooms, auditorium, well equipped laboratories, a voluminous
            Library, a multipurpose hall, a large play ground and indoor basket ball court. The feeder Kindergarten is
            located in a different campus a little farther away from the main school.
